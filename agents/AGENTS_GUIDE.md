## Agents Guide

Use these files with Claude Code (project-scoped) or as prompt seeds for GPT‑5/Codex.

- agents/ROLE_PROMPTS.md — copy/paste role prompts
- agents/claude/.claude/agents/*.md — Custom Agents for Claude Code
- agents/claude/.claude/settings.json — Hook to run lint/typecheck after edits

Tips:
- Keep prompts short and specific
- Refer agents to PRD_SIP_PRI_Migration_Tool.md and CSV_SPECS.md as the source of truth
- Ask agents to output unified diffs and a short validation summary
